Observing Similarities in Tumor formation from Cap Analysis Gene Expression

Problem:

Cancer is a disease that is affecting millions of people worldwide. As the scientific community continues to progress towards further understanding of how cancer forms, many questions still remain especially in regards to the genetic basis of cancer. Further developing our understanding of gene expression profiles in various forms of cancer could greatly shape the future of how cancer is attacked at a genetic level moving forward.

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to find out whether or not there are overlapping gene expression profiles between various types of tumors, both benign and malignant. Finding similarities in gene expression between different types of cancers could allow scientists to dig deeper beyond those similarities into why these genes are being expressed in multiple types of cancer. Observing this could also allow scientists to spend more time on genes that are showing more importance in the gene expression landscape of cancer and provide a more targeted approach that could possibly lead us to faster cures.
